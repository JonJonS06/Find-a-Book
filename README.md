## Description

In this application we were given a functional restful api application and our task was to refactor it to be GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. I utilized the MERN Stack by using MongoDB for the database, Express.js and Node.js for the server and API, and React for the frontend. The functionality of the application is the ability for the user to create an account, search for books, and save the books for later.

## Deployed Application

I even tried on another site but was not successful. Really wish I had more time. ðŸ˜ž Error I kept getting was `MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017` )
